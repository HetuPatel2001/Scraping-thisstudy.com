# Scraping-thisstudy.com

    I recently got an assignment to scrape thisstudy.com(https://thistudy.com/index.php?board=162) and extract data like the Questions, Answers and Views of the question. I did this with the help to Beautiful Soup library and then stored the data in a csv file format by using the Pandas library in python. The data.csv file consist of data of the first 5 pages.
